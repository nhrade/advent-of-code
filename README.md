This is the repository for my advent of code submissions. For the Haskell submissions GHC must be installed using an installer or brew install ghc with version 8.10.7. Python uses numpy and Python 3.10. I chose haskell when I could and used Python when it was easier. Not all the submissions are done, I've skipped some that I am waiting until later to do.


On mac it can be installed as.

```bash
brew install ghc
brew install pyenv
pyenv install 3.10.0
pyenv local 3.10.0
python -m venv .env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or using the install_mac.sh script
`./install_mac.sh`

Haskell files are run with `runhaskell file.hs`

Python files are run as `python file.py`
