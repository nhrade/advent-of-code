repository for my advent of code submissions


This is the repository for my advent of code submissions. For the Haskell submissions GHC must be installed using an installer or brew install ghc with version 8.10.7. Python uses numpy and Python 3.10.


On mac it can be installed as.
`brew install ghc`
`brew install python3`
`pip3 install numpy`
